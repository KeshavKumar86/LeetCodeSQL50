LeetCode SQL 50 Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to the LeetCode SQL 50 problem set.
Each query is written with clarity and efficiency in mind, focusing on concepts like:
Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
Subqueries (scalar, correlated)
Aggregations and GROUP BY
Window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER, etc.)
Conditional logic using CASE
Performance considerations in query design
# The goal of this repo is to serve as a reference for revising SQL concepts, improving query-writing skills, and preparing for interviews where SQL is tested.
